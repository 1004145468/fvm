## Overview

This tool allows you to manage multiple channels and releases, and caches these versions locally, so you don't have to wait for a full setup every time you want to switch versions.

Also, it allows you to grab versions by a specific release, i.e., `v1.2.0` or `1.17.0-dev.3.1`. In case you have projects in different Flutter SDK versions and do not want to upgrade.
